- Don’t forget to introduce yourself to help work out everyone’s nerves.

- “Tell me about your background” is not a useful question for a tech interview.

- Probe when you see a resume with a long list of skills. Separate the truth from filler.

- Don’t “try out” new questions on candidates. Know what a good answer sounds like.

- Make sure you have them write code! This is too often skipped.

- Dig into algorithms, data structures, code organization, simplicity.

- Use some questions that are vague and open-ended. See if they ask you questions to find out more.

- Ask a design question. See how people think about a bigger picture problem.

- Create core competences for your company. Make sure candidates measure up well.

- Make it tough but fun. Good developers want to know they’re talking to smart folks.
